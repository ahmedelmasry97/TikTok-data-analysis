# **TikTok** data analysis
analyzing Tiktok data by practicing Exploratory data analysis and after that measuring the correlation between some variables and practicing linear & logistic regression models and hypothesis testing  
**about TikTok** data     
the TikTok data contains variables about claim status and their video views, likes, shares, and comments, as well as data about verified status, and author ban status. The goal of this analysis is to conduct EDA analysis to answer some questions like    
how many claims vs opinion videos?  
the mean views, likes, shares, and comments for claim vs opinion videos?   
the mean views, likes, shares, and comments for  verified accounts  vs  unverified accounts?  
the engagement rates  for clams vs opinion videos?  
the total views for clams vs opinion videos?  
the total views for unverified accounts vs unverified accounts?  
the total views for  author ban status ?  and much more ...  

and after these questions are answered, we will continue advanced analysis like hypothesis analysis and linear and logistic regression.
